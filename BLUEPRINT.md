# Ethics 101 — App Blueprint

A complete architectural blueprint for the Ethics 101 4-unit college Ethics course. This document is the single reference for what the app does, how it's wired, and the contracts between pieces. For day-to-day commands and gotchas see `replit.md`.

---

## 1. Product summary

Ethics 101 is a self-paced, single-user, no-login web course covering a four-unit college Ethics curriculum (27 topics, grounded in "Some Fundamental Principles Relating to Ethics"). Students read AI-rewritten lecture notes at three lengths, ask an AI tutor scoped to the section they're reading, drill on adaptive practice problems, and submit homework / tests / midterm / final that are AI-graded and AI-detection-screened.

The product surface is three deployable artifacts in one pnpm monorepo:

| Artifact | Slug | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@workspace/api-server` | `api-server` | Express 5 API mounted at `/api`. Owns the DB, OpenAI calls, AI detection, grading, diagnostics. |
| `@workspace/qr-course` | `qr-course` | Student-facing React + Vite app. The actual course. |
| `@workspace/qr-course-demo` | `qr-course-demo` | A screencast-style product demo video, exported as MP4 from the preview pane. |

Shared contracts live in `lib/`:

- `lib/api-spec` — OpenAPI source of truth.
- `lib/api-zod` — generated Zod validators (used by the server).
- `lib/api-client-react` — generated React Query hooks (used by `qr-course`).
- `lib/db` — Drizzle schema + db client.

---

## 2. Domain model (Postgres + Drizzle)

Source: `lib/db/src/schema/course.ts`.

```
topics ──< lectures              (one topic, one lecture per length)
topics ──< problems              (problems tagged to a topic for analytics)
assignments ──< problems         (homework / test / midterm / final)
assignments ──< attempts ──< answers
                                ↑ per-answer keystroke trace + AI scores
practice_sessions ──< practice_problems ──< practice_attempts
                                            ↑ adaptive difficulty session
```

Notable columns:

- `lectures.body` / `body_medium` / `body_long` — the Short / Medium / Long toggle is three pre-baked LLM rewrites of the same lecture.
- `answers.{keystrokeCount,eraseCount,bulkInsertCount,longestBulkInsertChars,rewriteSegments,durationMs}` — the **diachronic trace**. Captured client-side from the textarea and submitted with the answer.
- `answers.{aiScore,aiFlagged,diachronicScore,diachronicFlagged,detectionRationale}` — frozen detection outcome at submission time.
- `practice_sessions.difficulty` (1–4, double) — adapts session-by-session based on streaks / accuracy.

Push schema with `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`.

---

## 3. API surface (OpenAPI-first)

Source: `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml`. **Never** hand-edit `lib/api-zod/src/generated/*` or `lib/api-client-react/src/generated/*` — change the spec and run `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen`.

Tag groups and what they own:

| Tag | Endpoints | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `course` | `GET /course/overview`, `GET /course/weeks/{n}`, `GET /course/lectures/{id}` | Read the static course tree. Lectures return Short/Medium/Long bodies. |
| `tutor` | `POST /tutor/ask` (SSE), `GET /tutor/suggestions/{lectureId}` | Streaming AI tutor scoped to a lecture section. Suggestions are pre-generated starter questions. |
| `practice` | `POST /practice/sessions`, `POST /practice/sessions/{id}/next`, `POST /practice/sessions/{id}/attempts` | Adaptive practice: server generates the next problem, scoring it adjusts session `difficulty`. |
| `assignments` | `GET /assignments`, `GET /assignments/{id}`, `POST /assignments/{id}/attempt`, `PUT /assignments/{id}/attempts/{aid}/answers/{pid}`, `POST /assignments/{id}/attempts/{aid}/submit` | Homework / test flow. Submit endpoint triggers AI grade + detection per answer. |
| `analytics` | `GET /analytics/summary`, `GET /analytics/topics`, `GET /analytics/activity` | KPIs, topic mastery, recent activity. |
| `detection` | `POST /detection/scan` | Run AI + diachronic detection on an arbitrary text + trace. Used directly by the diagnostics page. |
| `diagnostics` | `GET /diagnostics/system`, `POST /diagnostics/synthetic-run`, `POST /diagnostics/quality-control`, `POST /diagnostics/expand-lectures`, `POST /diagnostics/reset` | Self-tests and seed maintenance. See §6. |

The submit endpoint's response schema (`AttemptResult`) bundles `score / total / percent / perProblem[] / detection[]` so the UI can render the AI-grade + detection verdict in one round-trip.

```

### 4.2 Conventions

- **Validation:** every handler parses input with `safeParse` from `@workspace/api-zod` and re-`parse`s outputs before sending. Never trust the request body, never trust your own response.
- **Logging:** `req.log.info(...)` inside routes; singleton `logger` everywhere else. **Never** `console.log` in server code.
- **OpenAI:** all model calls go through `lib/ai.ts` (`chatText`, `chatJson`, `chatStream`, `FAST_MODEL`). The Replit AI proxy means no API key is needed in dev or prod.
- **Errors:** thrown errors bubble to a global error handler that logs and returns `{ error: string }` with the right status. Detection failures are **non-fatal** — they return `null` and the caller falls back.

---

## 5. AI detection — `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/detection.ts`

Detection is the project's signature feature. It runs **two independent functions** and bundles their outputs into one `DetectionOutcome`.

### 5.1 Detection Function 1 — Static AI detection (GPTZero, with fallback)

Question answered: *"Was this text written by an LLM?"*

Pipeline:

1. **`gptzeroAiScore(text)`** — calls `POST https://api.gptzero.me/v2/predict/text` with `x-api-key: $GPTZERO_API_KEY`. Reads `documents[0].class_probabilities.ai` (plus half-weight of `mixed`), falls back to `completely_generated_prob`. Returns `null` on missing key, network failure, malformed response, or text shorter than 40 chars.
2. **`heuristicAiScore(text)`** — local zero-dependency scorer. Penalises long average sentence length plus presence of LLM tells (`delve`, `tapestry`, `leverag(e|ing)`, `in conclusion`, `it is important to note`, `plays a crucial/vital/pivotal role`, etc.). Used as anchor + fallback.
3. **`llmAiScore(text)`** — secondary fallback. Asks the OpenAI proxy in JSON-only mode for `{"probability": 0..1}`. Used only when GPTZero is unavailable.

Blend (`detect()`):

```
if GPTZero responded:           aiScore = 0.85 * gptzero + 0.15 * heuristic
elif LLM scorer responded:      aiScore = 0.60 * llm     + 0.40 * heuristic
else:                           aiScore = heuristic
```

`aiFlagged = aiScore >= 0.55`.

### 5.2 Detection Function 2 — Diachronic detection (keystroke pattern)

Question answered: *"Did the student paste AI output and reword it to sound human?"*

This is the novel part: even if the final text passes GPTZero (because the student edited the wording), the **act of producing it** looks nothing like organic typing.

`diachronicScore(text, trace)` reads a `TraceInput` captured by the client:

```
{ keystrokeCount, eraseCount, bulkInsertCount?, longestBulkInsertChars?,
  rewriteSegments?, durationMs }
```

It adds penalty points for:

| Signal | Penalty | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `longestBulkInsertChars > 40` *or* `longestBulkInsertChars / textLen > 0.4` | +0.50 | One paste covers most of the answer. |
| `bulkInsertCount >= 2 && longestBulkInsert > 25` | +0.15 | Multiple paste events. |
| `keystrokeCount / textLen < 0.6` with `textLen > 30` | +0.30 | Far fewer keys pressed than characters of output — paste-like. |
| `charsPerSecond > 12` with `textLen > 30` | +0.20 | Sustained typing speed no human freshman maintains. |
| `longestBulkInsert > 30 && rewriteSegments >= 2` | +0.15 | Big paste followed by reword passes — the giveaway pattern. |

Clamped to `[0, 1]`. `diachronicFlagged = diachronicScore >= 0.55`.

### 5.3 Combined outcome

`detect()` returns:

```ts
{
  aiScore, aiFlagged,
  diachronicScore, diachronicFlagged,
  rationale: string  // human-readable explanation incl. GPTZero %
}
```

This outcome is persisted on `answers` at submit time and surfaces in the assignment results UI plus the diagnostics page.

---

## 6. Diagnostics surface

Three routes, one page. The page lives at `artifacts/qr-course/src/pages/Diagnostics.tsx` and is linked from the student app. **These are operator tools, not student-facing features.**

### 6.1 `GET /api/diagnostics/system` — system self-test

Runs a strict ordered checklist and returns `{ ok, generatedAt, steps[] }`. Each step has `{ name, ok, ms, detail?, error? }`. The student page renders one row per step with pass/fail and timing.

Steps:

1. **Environment** — `DATABASE_URL` present.
2. **Database** — `SELECT 1` round-trip.
3. **Database** — course content is seeded (≥27 topics, ≥1 lecture / assignment / problem).
4. **OpenAI** — fast-model chat completion returns non-empty text.
5. **OpenAI** — JSON mode returns `{ ok: true }`.
6. **Detection** — heuristic+scoring pipeline returns numbers for a benign sentence.
7. **AI detection** — pasted-style LLM-tell text **flags** as AI.
8. **GPTZero** — if `GPTZERO_API_KEY` is set, the real API responds and gives a non-null score.

If any step fails the page shows the red row and the raw error string from the server — that's the debugging surface.

### 6.2 `POST /api/diagnostics/synthetic-run` — end-to-end synthetic student

Simulates a real student session against the live DB and reports each leg pass/fail/timing. Useful when refactoring the practice loop or grading pipeline. Stages roughly:

1. Create a practice session for a known topic.
2. Pull the first problem (`/practice/sessions/{id}/next`).
3. Submit a wrong answer, then a right one — confirm difficulty adjusts and accuracy persists.
4. Create an assignment attempt, answer each problem, submit, and verify `AttemptResult` returns full `perProblem[]` + `detection[]`.
5. Hit analytics endpoints and confirm the new attempt is reflected.

### 6.3 `POST /api/diagnostics/quality-control` — OpenAI answer-key legitimacy check

Independently re-derives the answer to a sample of course problems and verifies each seeded answer key is legitimate. Returns `{ ok, generatedAt, steps[] }` like the other diagnostics. Stages:

1. Collect every assignment problem joined to its assignment, grouped by unit, and sample up to 12 with a guaranteed per-unit quota so every unit is covered even if its problem count is uneven.
2. For each sampled problem, run a **two-phase** check: (a) the LLM independently re-derives an answer from the prompt **alone**, blind to the seeded key, so the verdict can't just rubber-stamp the key; (b) a second LLM call judges whether the seeded key is legitimate given the prompt + the independent answer, using the grader's semantic-equivalence philosophy — accepting any correct on-topic short answer and flagging only genuinely defective keys (wrong, off-topic, self-contradictory, contradicted on substance, or ungradeable). Returns `{ legitimate, confidence, rationale }`; malformed verdicts are treated as failures, not passes.
3. A legitimate key passes its step; a flagged key fails its step with the model's rationale. A final summary step reports the legitimate/flagged tally.

### 6.4 Supporting routes (not in the diagnostics UI)

- `POST /api/diagnostics/expand-lectures` — generates `body_medium` / `body_long` for lectures that are missing them. Idempotent.
- `POST /api/diagnostics/reset` — wipes attempts / answers / practice for a clean demo. **Does not** drop course content.

---

## 7. Student app — `@workspace/qr-course`

React + Vite + Tailwind. Routes:

| Route | Page | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | `Dashboard` | Assignments progress + Course Schedule + Recent Activity |
| `/weeks/:weekNumber` | `WeekView` | List of week's lectures and assignments |
| `/lectures/:lectureId` | `LectureView` | Lecture body + Short/Medium/Long toggle + right-rail tutor / practice |
| `/practice/topic/:topicId` | `TopicPractice` | Adaptive single-topic drill |
| `/assignments` | `Assignments` | All homework / tests / midterm / final |
| `/assignments/:id` | `AssignmentRunner` | Take + review an assignment; shows AI grade + detection per answer |
| `/analytics` | `Analytics` | KPIs, topic mastery table, recent activity |
| `/diagnostics` | `Diagnostics` | Operator self-test UI (see §6) |

All server data goes through the **generated** React Query hooks from `@workspace/api-client-react`. No fetch logic should be hand-written in components.

### 7.1 Diachronic trace capture

The answer `<textarea>` is wrapped in a hook (lives in the assignment runner / topic practice) that:

- Counts every `keydown` (excluding modifier-only) into `keystrokeCount`.
- Increments `eraseCount` on Backspace/Delete.
- On every `input` event, compares the new value to the previous: if the diff inserted ≥4 chars in one tick, that's a "bulk insert" — increment `bulkInsertCount` and update `longestBulkInsertChars`.
- Detects a "rewrite segment" when characters are erased mid-string and then replaced with new ones (not at the tail).
- Stamps `durationMs` = (submit time − first focus time).

The trace is included in the answer `PUT` body and on `POST submit`, then stored verbatim on `answers` so detection is reproducible.

## 8. Demo video — `@workspace/qr-course-demo`

A **screencast-style** product walkthrough, **not** a marketing reel. Built per the `video-js` skill: React + framer-motion, exported to MP4 from the preview pane via the browser recorder.

### 8.1 Structure

```
artifacts/qr-course-demo/src/components/video/
├── VideoTemplate.tsx        scene router + persistent sidebar + persistent cursor + background audio
├── VideoWithControls.tsx    iframe-only wrapper: scene jump, scene-lock, mute toggle
├── useSceneControls.ts      hook hiding jump/lock workarounds for the read-only useVideoPlayer
├── CursorPointer.tsx        animated SVG arrow that drives the "user is clicking" feel
├── TypewriterText.tsx       char-by-char typing into inputs
├── StreamingText.tsx        word-by-word AI-response streaming
├── TypingIndicator.tsx      three pulsing dots
└── video_scenes/
    ├── Scene1.tsx           Dashboard → Week 1 (8s)
    ├── Scene2.tsx           Lecture: Short/Long toggle + Practice/Tutor tabs (8s)
    ├── Scene3.tsx           Tutor Q&A with streaming response (12s)
    ├── Scene4.tsx           Analytics with counting KPIs + topic mastery click (10s)
    ├── Scene5.tsx           Topic Practice: wrong → adjust ↓ → right → adjust ↑ (14s)
    └── Scene6.tsx           Assignments review with AI grade + AI-detection chip (10s)
```

`SCENE_DURATIONS` sums to **62 seconds**, looped.

### 8.2 Key architectural rules

- **Sidebar persistence.** The Dashboard / Assignments / Analytics sidebar lives in `VideoTemplate.tsx` outside `<AnimatePresence>`. Only the right-pane scene swaps. Active highlight is derived from `sceneIndex`.
- **Cursor persistence.** `CursorPointer` lives outside `<AnimatePresence>` and is driven by `setCursorPos / setIsClicking` passed into every scene.
- **The UI is rebuilt, not screenshotted.** Scenes use the real fonts and colors but every pixel is JSX. `attached_assets/qr-screens/*.jpg` were reference-only.
- **`AnimatePresence` key = `currentSceneKey`** (NOT `baseSceneKey`). When scene-lock toggles `_r1` / `_r2` on the durations object, both iterations must remount and re-animate.
- **Audio.** One bg music file at `public/audio/bg_music.mp3` (62s, instrumental piano + strings, generated). Scene-synced via `SCENE_START_SEC` — on every scene change the audio seeks to that scene's canonical start offset (epsilon 0.18s).
- **Mute wiring.** Iframe preview defaults to muted; control bar exposes `Volume2` / `VolumeX`. Export path renders `<VideoTemplate />` with no props → unmuted, no controls. The mute toggle is **declarative JSX (`<audio muted={muted}>`) only** — it must not also re-seek `audio.currentTime`, or unmute restarts the scene's audio.

### 8.3 Scene controls

`useSceneControls` exposes `jumpTo(index)`, `toggleLock()`, `activeIndex`, `locked`, `durations`, `mountKey`, `tick`. It rotates the durations object on jump and replaces it with `{ key_r1, key_r2 }` on lock to force `useVideoPlayer` to loop a single scene. `VideoWithControls` reads `window.self !== window.top` and renders the control bar only inside the iframe so MP4 exports stay clean.

### 8.4 Export

Recording fires `window.startRecording()` on first scene mount and `window.stopRecording()` after the last scene. Audio is part of the recorded tab capture — so the exported MP4 contains the music.

---

## 9. README contract

`replit.md` is the always-loaded project README. It contains:

1. **Run & Operate** — every command needed in day-to-day work.
2. **Required env / secrets** — `DATABASE_URL`, `GPTZERO_API_KEY`, `SESSION_SECRET`; OpenAI via Replit AI Integrations proxy (no key).
3. **Stack** — exact runtime versions and tools.
4. **Where things live** — pointer map: OpenAPI spec, generated hooks, DB schema, route files, detection lib, AI lib, pages, demo scenes.
5. **Product** — 6-bullet description of what the student actually does.
6. **Architecture decisions** — non-obvious choices: contract-first API, single composite logger, GPTZero failure is non-fatal, demo video is a real React app.
7. **User preferences** — be direct, no preamble, screencast not marketing reel.
8. **Gotchas** — don't edit generated files; don't rename `info.title`; video scaffold typecheck noise is harmless; restart workflows, don't `pnpm dev` at root; demo export includes audio.

If you change anything in this blueprint, update `replit.md` to match — they are the long-form and short-form views of the same truth.

---

## 10. End-to-end request example

A student submits Homework 1.1. The full path:

1. Browser: `qr-course/src/pages/AssignmentRunner.tsx` calls the generated `useSubmitAttempt()` hook with `{ traces: { [problemId]: TraceInput } }`.
2. Generated client: `POST /api/assignments/{id}/attempts/{aid}/submit`, validated against `SubmitAttemptBody` Zod schema.
3. Express route (`routes/assignments.ts`):
   - Loads `attempt` + `answers` + `problems` from Drizzle.
   - For each answer: calls `gradeAnswer(problem, answer)` (OpenAI JSON mode, returns `{ correct, rationale }`) **and** `detect(answer.text, trace)` in parallel.
   - Writes `correct`, `aiScore`, `aiFlagged`, `diachronicScore`, `diachronicFlagged`, `detectionRationale` back onto each answer row.
   - Updates `attempts.status = "submitted"`, computes `scorePercent`.
4. Returns `AttemptResult` validated against the generated Zod schema.
5. Browser: `AssignmentRunner` renders per-problem cards with the AI grade rationale + a detection chip (`Human-written response · confidence 94%` or `AI-detected · 91%`).

Every layer in that chain (spec → server zod → server logic → client hook → client zod) is generated or validated from the same `openapi.yaml`. Don't introduce a parallel path.
